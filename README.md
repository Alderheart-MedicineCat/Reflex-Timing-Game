# Reflex-Timing-Game

An iteration of a game that I created. The first version runs on console, but the next runs on turtle.

Special thanks to TmGopnik from StackOverflow for helping me with the keyboard module on my V1!

to install keyboard module, I went on command promt as admin and typed this: *pip install keyboard*. There is also a similar module that can be installed by using *pip install mouse*. I don't use the mouse module in my code, but it's a really helpful module that you should have.
